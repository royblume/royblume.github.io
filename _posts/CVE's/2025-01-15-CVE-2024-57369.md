Explanation of CVE-2024-57369
---

The typecho v1.2.1 is vulnerable to Clickjacking on the ```/install.php``` page. Clickjacking, also known as a "UI redress attack", is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top-level page. Thus, the attacker is "hijacking" clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both. Clickjacking vulnerabilities can be mitigated by implementing the ```X-Frame-Options``` HTTP response header, using the ```frame-ancestors``` directive in the Content Security Policy, and including defensive code in the UI, such as JavaScript-Based frame busting.
