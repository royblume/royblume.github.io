Description of CVE-2024-57372
---
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in InformationPush master version allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the ```title```, ```time```, and ```msg``` parameters.

## Vulnerable Code:
As shown in the lines 24 - 28 of ```msg.php```, the code directly embeds user-supplied data from the ```$_REQUEST``` array into the HTML document. Since there is no sanitization or validation of the ```title```, ```time```, and ```msg``` values, the input is directly inserted into the HTML, which allows attackers to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the webpage.

## Proof-of-Concept: 
Weaponized, an attacker can craft a malicious request to include JavaScript payloads or malicious HTML that will be rendered by the browser by setting the value of ```title```, ```time```, and ```msg```.  <br>
